# Modive - A Modern Next.js Application

This is a comprehensive Next.js project designed with modern best practices, including internationalization, theming, and a robust development environment.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager.

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Setup Environment Variables:**
    You need to set up environment variables to run the application properly.

    ```bash
    # Copy the example environment file
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    **Important:** Contact **"tiennguyen"** to get the required environment variable values for your `.env` file. The application may not work correctly without proper environment configuration.

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Start the Next.js development server.

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Workflow

To maintain code quality and consistency, please use the following scripts after making changes.

- **Type Checking:**
  Verifies TypeScript types across the project.

  ```bash
  pnpm type-check
  ```

- **Linting:**
  Finds and fixes problems in your code based on our ESLint configuration.

  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  ```

- **Formatting:**
  Automatically formats code using Prettier to ensure a consistent style.

  ```bash
  pnpm format
  ```

- **Building for Production:**
  Compiles and optimizes the application for production. This is a good way to check for build errors before committing.
  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```

## Key Technologies & Notes

This project leverages several key technologies to provide a modern development experience.

- **Styling:**
  - **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
  - **SCSS:** Used within CSS Modules (`*.module.scss`) for structured, component-scoped styles.

- **Internationalization (i18n):**
  - **`next-intl`:** Handles routing, message loading, and translations. Language files are located in the `/messages` directory.

- **Theming (Dark/Light Mode):**
  - **`next-themes`:** Manages theme switching and persists user preferences. Theming is configured via Tailwind's `darkMode: 'class'` strategy.

## Recommended VS Code Extensions

To get the best development experience, we highly recommend installing the following Visual Studio Code extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

## Project Structure

A brief overview of the key directories in this project:

- **/src/app**: Contains all aplication routes, following the Next.js App Router structure.
- **/src/components**: Reusable UI components (e.g., `Spinner`, `ThemeSwitcher`).
- **/src/lib**: Houses core library files and "registry" components (e.g., `theme-registry`, `antd-registry`).
- **/src/styles**: Global styles and font configurations.
- **/messages**: Contains JSON files for translations used by `next-intl`.
